suppose we have a lot of files which we want to compile then we can make a makefile. This file automates this task. We can keep record of how many files are compiled and how many are not 


final: final.o
	g++ final.o -o final

final.o:final.cpp
	g++ -c final.cpp


clean:
	rm *.o final

above is the code

The syntax is 

target:input
tab	command

then we write make in terminal and commands are executed. If the files made after make are already up to date then this does not let another compilation take place.

writing make clean will execute the command in clean section
