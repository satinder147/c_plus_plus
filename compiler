produces object files

1)preprocess the code
2)tokenizing and parsing creates abstract syntax tree

compiler compiles all the .cpp files and convert them object files
files have no meaning, files can have other extension as well.


preprocessing
--------------------------------------------

#include pastes whatever is inside a header file to the current file
g++ -E f.cpp shows the preprocessed output


object file consists of the machine code that the cpu runs


Linking 
goes from object file to executable files
