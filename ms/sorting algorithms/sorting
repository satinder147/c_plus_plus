bubble sort
The largest element bubbles out every time. 
It is an comparison sort
it is stable 
complexity best =n. average n^2 worst =n^2
space complexity =o(1)
sorting in place


selection sort
At every iteration find the min and place it in front
time complexity =0(n^2) for all the cases
space complexity =o(1)
stable --> no
inplace sorting algorithm

unstability example 4 2 3 4 1
Selection sort can be made stable

so we can make it stable by shifting elements one step at a time(like insertion sort)

int key = a[min]; 
        while (min > i)  
        { 
            a[min] = a[min - 1]; 
            min--; 
        } 
        a[i] = key; 

this logic comes inside


insertion sort
stable
inplace
worst n^2
average n^2
best n
space complexity =o(1)

Uses: Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.





Merge sort
We know that if we have two sorted arrays, then we can merge them in o(n). Now Merge sort utilizes this logic. It recursively splits the arrays till we have 1 element in each array. As single elements are already sorted we can merge these lists.
Complexity o(nlogn) in all three cases
space 0(n)
divide and conquer algorithm
Sorting in not in place
it is a stable algorithm



Quicksort
complexity 0(nlogn) in best and average case
complexity is o(n^2) in worst case
in place
quicksort is not stable
pivot should be element ehich is the mdeian of first,last and the middle element, or the median of three randomally selected variables
