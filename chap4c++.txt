name hiding or shadowing-----the nested variable hides the outer variable
it means I can declare a variable in a if statement which is already declared in the main function but if the nested variable is not defined then the inner variable use refers to the outer block variable.


global variables have static duration and file scope(or global or global namespace scope)

we can have empty block as well in c++
int main()
{
    int y(5); // we're declaring y here because we need it in this outer block later
 
    {
        int x;
        std::cin >> x;
        // if we declared y here, immediately before its actual first use...
        if (x == 4)
            y = 4;
    } // ... it would be destroyed here
 
    std::cout << y; // and we need y to exist here
 
    return 0;
}


global variables
name hiding or shadowing also occurs in case of global variables
the same name variable defined in a block hides the global variable
by default the local variable is used in a block, to refer to the global variable :: is used before the variable name.

In addition to scope and duration, variables have a third property: linkage. A variable’s linkage determines whether multiple instances of an identifier refer to the same variable or not.

Two local variables with the same name but defined in different functions have no linkage -- each will be considered an independent variable.

A variable with internal linkage is called internal variable or static variable.Variables with internal linkage can be used anywhere within the file they are defined in, but can not be referenced outside the file they exist in.
TO make a global variable variable internal we have to write static in front of it
.i.e static int x;
THis variable can be used in the file but cannot be used outside the file.



A variable with external linkage is called external variable.
TO make a global variable externl we use the keyword "extern"

.i.e extern int x(20);
For linking functions in other files we used to write forward declaration. Now for linking these externl variables also, we have to write forward declaration.
Suppose in a.cpp we write extern int x(20);
To use this in main.cpp we have to write extern int x;

The variables has to be initialized in a.cpp, otherwise it will look like a forward declaration. So we we can't use extern for external linking where we are not initializing this variable.


So extern is used in both the places.


the term “file scope” is more often applied to file scope variables with internal linkage only, and “global scope” to file scope variables with external linkage.

which means global variables will have default external linkage, and we only ned forward declaration to use them in other files.

Now suppose I have a c.h file which consists of constants.
Now when this file will be included in other .cpp files, there will a lot of copies of these constants. Now there is no problem with the copies, but the if c.h is changed all the other files have to compiled again. To solve this problem we have c.h will have only forward declarations of the constants, whereas c.cpp will contain the defined constants.Now to use these constants we can #include "c.h" and now we can use all those constants, and only the c.cpp has to be recompiled incase of any change. or we can define the constants in the header file as well


// Uninitialized definition:
int g_x;        // defines uninitialized global variable (external linkage)
static int g_x; // defines uninitialized static variable (internal linkage)
const int g_x;  // not allowed: const variables must be initialized
 
// Forward declaration via extern keyword:
extern int g_z;       // forward declaration for global variable defined elsewhere
extern const int g_z; // forward declaration for const global variable defined elsewhere
 
// Initialized definition:
int g_y(1);        // defines initialized global variable (external linkage)
static int g_y(1); // defines initialized static variable (internal linkage)
const int g_y(1);  // defines initialized const variable (internal linkage)
 
// Initialized definition w/extern keyword:
extern int g_w(1);       // defines initialized global variable (external linkage, extern keyword is redundant in this case)
extern const int g_w(1); 




global static variables make the variable internal. Whereas static variables which are decalred and defined in a function behave differently
Static variables offer some of the benefit of global variables (they don’t get destroyed until the end of the program) while limiting their visibility to block scope. This makes them much safer for use than global variables.

static local variables are initialized with zero. Similarly global variables are also initiated
 as 0

meaning 

namespace x{
void sum()
{}

}
namespace x{
void product()
{}

}

overall result is namespace x has both the functions 


In C++17, nested namespaces can also be declared this way:

1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
#include <iostream>
 
namespace Foo::Goo // Goo is a namespace inside the Foo namespace (C++17 style)
{
    const int g_x = 5;
}
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << Foo::Goo::g_x;
    return 0;
}




Functions have default linking. So limit the use of function to only one file we write static void int add(int a,int b)


static variable have only one copy of them .
remember function (increment) static variables are different from the global ones in the way that they are limited to their local scope only.




4.3B namespaces

If i declare two functions with same signature in two different header files and I include those header files in a single program, then I will encounter an error. both the functions weew in global namespace.
to sove such errors we have namespaces.

A namespace defines an area of code in which all identifiers are guaranteed to be unique
by default global variables and normal functions are having global namespace (::)
So as to prevent the upper error we write the function in a namespace 

synatax

namespace namespace_name
{
write your code 
}

do the same in both the header files
Now accessing the varibales using scope resolution operator(::)
to accesss a veriable namespace_name::function or variable name


you can have same namespace in two differrent files as well if the functions or variables inside them are not have the same name 

nested namespaces-->
namespaces can be nested 
syntax
namespace namespace_name1
{
namespace namespace_name2
{
code
}
}

to refer to code write namespace_n1::namespace_n2::code
we can declare nested namespace as:
namespace n1::n2
{
code
}
this exactly means the same as above

we may have so many layers of nested namepace
so we can interchangably write it in another way
for n1::n2::n3::n4::n5::code
we can write it as boo=n1::n2::n3::n4::n5
boo::code


using statements
if I write using std::cout
then instead of writing std::cout everywhere I can write cout
if we had declared two cout's then the compiler would have chosen the one with std::

using namespace std--using directive statement
we can write this statement in main function as well
writing two using statement in the main function will cause error
if we had declared two couts then it would have caused an error

using namespace std should be always used in a block (like main function)

directives should be avoided
if we write two using namespace statements then the one which is written below will be executed. 

using namespace n1
code1
using namespace n2
code2
n1 will expire after code1 
and then n2 will be used

this is the only way to cancel the effect of a namespace.




implicit type conversion
the compilter often converts the variables to the same data type so that it can do the operations between them.

for arithmatic operations if two short ints are added then then both the short's are converted to integer (promoted)
if suppose we are adding a double and a short
then first the short will be converted to integer, then out of integer and double, double has more priority so the integer is converted to double and the final result is a double

the priority table is as follows

long double (highest)
double
float
unsigned long long
long long
unsigned long
long
unsigned int
int (lowest)

explicit casting
In C++, there are 5 different types of casts: C-style casts, static casts, const casts, dynamic casts, and reinterpret casts.
reinterpret cast and const cast should be avoided

cstyle casts-->
writing (datatype)variable casts the variable to the provided datatype
cstyle casts are not checked by the compiler at the compile time, so they are often misused, they let us get rid of the const as well.
**should be avoided

static cast
static_cast<datatype>(variable)
this cast is checked at compile time making it difficult for us to do things like converting const to a variable
static cast is less powerfull than c style cast but is better


string-->>
string input terminates at whitespaces and anything else given as input stays in cin and waits for the next extraction.
for ex 
cin>>name
cin>>age
we write name as satinder singh
then we get name as satinder 
and age as singh.

to read a complete line we shoudl use getline
why I used to write getline two time
this was because whenver we getline a number , the input is actually the number + newline, so c++ removes that new line character and puts it back in the cin stream, which is taken as the second input, to prevent this we can write getline two times or use std::cin.ignore(32767, '\n');

32767 because it is largest thing that an integer of size 2 byte can store.


enumerated types/
these are the simplest user defined data types
to define an enum 
enum enum_name
{
a,b,v,c,
};
we have a comma after the last element as well
to use 
enum_name obj=a;

each enumerator is assigned a value 1 greater than the previous item 
count starts from 0

enumerators can be be defined explicit values as well
like
enum enum_name
{
a=1,b,c,
};
best practice is not to assign values to enumerators

enumerators can be assigned to integers as well
but assigning int value to a enum object is not allowed
but this is possible
enum_name obj=static_cast<enum_name>(any int value like 3)*******

enumerators of one enum cannot be assigned to another one
enum variables have same size as of int

enum objects are assigned enum's enumerators only/
enums are used for error handling like we return -1 for an error, here -1 can be represnted by an enumerator with a good name.


enum classes
syntax
enum class name
{};
the only differnce being than the enumerators of two different enum classes cannot be compared with each other.They lie in different scope

Suppose I have a enum enum class color{};
and enum class fruit {};
in normal enums we could compare the color and fruit variables simply.
but here we have to write color::v1==fruit::v2


typedef 
these are aliases they can be used in place of a data type
for eg typedef double x;
wherever I have to write double now I can write x;

newer version of this type alias

using c=double;


structs--

are defined same as classes (same semicolon at the end)
everything is public though

struct e{int age,int roll etc};
to initalize a struct 
we write e e1{1,3,,,,,};// these values get assigned to each variables
but we can initiate explicitly as well by 




nested struct

struct Employee
{
    short id;
    int age;
    double wage;
};
 
struct Company
{
    Employee CEO; // Employee is a struct within the Company struct
    int numberOfEmployees;
};
 
Company myCompany;

to use ceo details we write mycompany.CEO.salary

to initalize such a structure we write 

Company myCompany = {{ 1, 42, 60000.0f }, 5 };

It turns out, we can only say that the size of a struct will be at least as large as the size of all the variables it contains. But it could be larger! For performance reasons, the compiler will sometimes add gaps into structures (this is called padding).



auto datatype
before c++ 11 the meaning of auto keyword was to tell that the memory allocated for the variable will be deallocated automatically
for eg auto int x, as soon as the local scope finished the variable also dies

but now the meaning of the keyword has changed

now auto keyword helps the language decide which data type is suitable for the variable
for eg auto c=1.5
c=double
the auto keyword has to be used with initialization 

int add(int x, int y);
auto add(int x, int y) -> int;
the above two statements are same.
