be carefull with declaring some variables inside the if,else blocks
the if statement without block runs the only line of code(comments are ignored but white spaced line is note ignored)

null statement is a statement with only a semicolon
x=0 evaluates to zero inside a if statement

switch(expression) the expression has to evalaute to a int type 
float or doubles for expression are not allowed

you cannot write initiazlization statements int b = 5 in the swittch block, alothough you can write int b;
b=5;

variables defined in one case statement can be used in other

goto statement

label:
code

goto label

goes to the label


the label can't be ahead of the goto statement.

the ways to get out of a infinite loop are 
break
return 
exit()
exception

for(;;) is an infinite loop


continue is used to premature incrementation 
using continue statement in while or do while makes them infiniete
