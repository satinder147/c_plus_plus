static library

Procedure for making a static library
1) suppose our library will contain two functions add() and sub()
and we have two files add.cpp,sub.cpp
then we will write the add() and sub() function in the add.cpp and sub.cpp respectively

2) Then we will convert the the cpp files to object files
using g++ -c add.cpp and g++ -c sub.cpp

3) Then these codes are converted into the library
in linux the convention is that the library's name has to start with lib and end with .a(meaning static)

ar rs libbasic.a add.o sub.o 
where name of our library is basic

Now we have to make a header file which will contain all the function declarations. 

So we will make a header file named basic.h
basic.h will contain all the function prototypes

now we can delete everything apart from basic.h and libbasic.a


Now we can include basic.h in our code and we can use add() and sub()

if the name of the above file is a.cpp
then we will compile a.cpp using g++ -c a.cpp
Now to run this we will write g++ -o a a.o libbasic.a
as the code of the library is required only at runtime so that is why it is provided to the linker
