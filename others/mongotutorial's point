mongodb is an open source database written in c++.

MongoDB works on concept of collection and document.

database is a physical container of collections

A collection is a comparable to a sql table. It is a group of mongodb documents. A collection resides in one database only.

It is analogous to a row of data.A document is a set of key pair values. A collection contains a lot of documents.
Documents have dynamic schema which means that the documents in a collection are not needed to contain similar fields
primary key is provided my mongodb database only.

_id is a hexadecimal number which assures the uniqueness of all the documents keys.
We can provide the _id.If we do not provide then mongodb will provide by it's own

first 4 bytes for the current timestamp, next 3 bytes for machine id, next 2 bytes for process id of MongoDB server and remaining 3 bytes are simple incremental VALUE.

db.stats()-->it gives the statistics of the current database-->like it's name, type and number of collection and much more

show dbs--> show's all the dbs
db --> shows the current db
use db_name--> create a new db with name db_name if the db does not exist else returns the previous one
db.dropDatabase--> drops the current database
default database for mongodb is test

when a database is dropped, if at that time I write db then it shows the db which is dropped
recently

db.createCollection("collection_name",options) a collection(table) is created 
db.collection_name.insert({name:"satinder"})
show collections--> shows the collections
db.collection_name.drop()-->drops the collection
