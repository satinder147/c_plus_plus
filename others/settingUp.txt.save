Installing anaconda is more beneficial


Download files can be checked for checksum
sha256sum returns the checksum of any file. This checksum can be matched with 
the checksum provided

echo "hash <space>*filename" | shasum -a 256 --check  (-a is for algorithm, --check checks the checksum of the two file provided)
prints OK if the hash and the hash of the filename matched

alternatively 
shasum -a 256 config.sh >config.sha
this produces a config.sha file --> the file contains what we have written in echo state (but it does not have a star)
this can be verified by shasum -a 256 -c config.sha


Putting an asterisk before the file name tells shasum to treat the file as binary if the system supports this. Id the file should be treated as text file you use a single blank instead.

Linux doesn't make a difference between binary and text files so it doesn't matter which one you use, but you can't leave it out.

So you have to use

<hash>  <filename>
with two blanks after the hash: One blank that separates the hash from the filename and one blank for text mode.
