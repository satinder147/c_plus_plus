standard convolution

input =dfxdfxm
shape of kernal =dkxdkxm
suppose we have n such filters then 
output =dgxdgxn(if f-k+1==g)

total cost
It is estimated by the number of multiplications

for 1 convolution--> mult once=dkxdkxm
but we stride the filter dg times in the width and dg times in the height
so multiplications per kernal (complete stride)==dgxdgxdkxdkxm
Now we have n such kernals so total number of calculations
dgxdgxdkxdkxmxn

Depth wise separable Convolution

Breaks the above operation into two steps
1. Depthwise Convolution(filtering stage)
2. Pointwise convolution: combination stage

Depthwise convolutions
applies convoloution to a single input channel at once

input=dfxdfxm
kernals are of shape dkxdkx1
since we apply kernal to only one channel we will require
m dkxdkx1 kernals
for each of the kernals the output is dgxdgx1
stacking these outputs from all the kernals together
results in dgxdgxm output volume


Second phase--point wise convolution
input =dgxdgxm
filter has shape 1x1xm
we will have n such filters
so output volume =dgxdgxn

number of multiplications in first phase

dkxdkxdgxdgxm

for second phase(point phase convolution)
multiplications =1x1xdgxdgxm=dgxdgxm
for n kernal dgxdgxmxn 
total =sum of both the phases
mxdgxdg(dkxdk+n)

comparision of both tthe covolutions

no. of multilication in depthwise /no . mult in standard conv=1/n+1/(dkxdk)

number of parameters comparision
=dkxdkxm+mxn/dkxdkxmxn
=1/n+1/(dkxdk) 

So depth wise convolution reduce number of calculations and number of multliplications


Applications
1) multimodal networks
2)xception is based on depth wise convolution
3)Mobile net for mobile devices
