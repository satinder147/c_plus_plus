friend function
----------------
By the rules of access specifiers the usage of the members of 
the class or struct is controlled.

C++ supports declaration of non member functions as "friend".

By this the function is granted access of all (private, protected and public) 
members of the class/struct .


FYI
------
The feature of granting access of private and protected members of 
the class violates abstraction.
Hence C++ loses Object Orientation.
