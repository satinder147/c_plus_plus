c++

it was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup

high level programs are converted into machine level code using two things
1)interpreter
2)compiler


Compiler reads a code and produces a standalone eecutable program that the cpu can understand directly.Once compiled, it is not necessary to be compiled again.

high level language-->compiler-->executable-->cpu-->program results

--------------------------------------------------
interpreter runs the code without compiling it into machine code first. interpreter are more flexible but they are less efficient as the interpretting process has to be done every time we run the code.
high level language--> interpreter-->cpu-->program results

eg perl and javascript


problem with c++ is that when the code is compiled it is compiled according to the platform specific functions which reducces the overall portability of the executable.

c++ is modified from c



how a problem is solved in c++
definition of the problem
design a solution
write  a program that implements the solution
compile the program
link object files
test and debug the program



Compiling  

Job of compiler is 
1)to check  your program and make sure it follows the rules of c++ language.
2)
to convert each file of the source code into machine language file called object file
object files are generally named abc.o, abc.obj.
where abc is from abc.cpp


when we write g++ -c file.cpp 
it produces file.o file.

Linking
Complete process of linking
It is the process of taking all the object files generated by the compiler and combining them into a single executable program that we can run. This process is called linking and is done by the linker





a.o+b.o+c.o +runtime support--->linker-->executable file

g++ -o prog file1.o file2.o file3.o 
-o tells g++ that we want an executable file named prog that is built from file1.o,file2.o...

the compile and link steps can be combined together using 
g++ -o prog file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp
This compiles and link steps together and directly to produce an executable.

Testing and debuggin



build configuration holds the setting for different version of your project




Few common problems in c++


if the wondow doesnt stop and vanishes 
then we have to do this after writing the complete code
cin.clear()
cin.ignore(32767,'\n')
cin.get();
